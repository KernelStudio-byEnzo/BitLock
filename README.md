# BitLock

BitLock is an online zero-knowledge vault. Passwords, notes, TOTP secrets,
crypto keys, and recovery codes are encrypted in the browser before they are
sent to the server. The hosted database stores ciphertext and the metadata
required to operate the account.

## Features

- Username-based accounts with legacy email sign-in compatibility
- AES-256-GCM encryption with a PBKDF2-derived key
- Passwords, links, encrypted notes, TOTP, crypto secrets, and recovery codes
- Multiple vaults, folders, tags, favorites, search, and item history
- Encrypted `.bitlock` backup import/export
- Password strength and reuse audit performed in the browser
- Revocable browser-extension token
- Voluntary Support page for disclosed sponsors and affiliate links
- French and English interface

## Stack

- Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Tailwind CSS
- Turso/libSQL in production
- Vercel Nitro preset
- `nuxt-auth-utils` encrypted session cookies

## Local development

Install dependencies and start Nuxt:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Without `TURSO_DB_URL`, development uses `bitlock-dev.db` in the project root.
The file is ignored by Git.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a session password of at least 32
characters:

```dotenv
NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
TURSO_DB_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io
TURSO_DB_TOKEN=your-token
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
SUPPORT_CATALOG_JSON=[]
```

## Support catalog

Support links are disabled by default. Configure them privately through
`SUPPORT_CATALOG_JSON`; the client never receives the environment variable
itself, only validated entries from `/api/support/catalog`.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "partner-id",
    "kind": "affiliate",
    "title": "Partner name",
    "description": "What the visitor will find after opening the link.",
    "url": "https://partner.example/path",
    "disclosure": "Affiliate link — BitLock may receive a commission."
  }
]
```

Only HTTPS destinations are accepted. Links open after an explicit user action
with `rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"`. No advertising SDK or third-party
analytics script is loaded inside the vault.

## Database

Create or update the Turso schema:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

The runtime also performs idempotent compatibility migrations. Existing hosted
accounts keep their original email identifier for sign-in while receiving a
unique username. New accounts are username-only.

## Validation

```bash
bun run test
bun run build
```

For the API smoke test, start the app first and run:

```bash
bun run test:smoke
```

## Deployment

Set `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD`, `TURSO_DB_URL`, `TURSO_DB_TOKEN`, and `APP_URL` in
Vercel, then deploy. `SUPPORT_CATALOG_JSON` is optional.
